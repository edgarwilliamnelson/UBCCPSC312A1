Term project for CPSC 312 at the University of British Columbia.

Early in our exposure to functional programming the class was tasked to take an existing piece of Haskell software and augment it in some form to add additional functionality. 

The assignment focused on understanding a project in depth written in an unfamiliar language, and then introducing non-trivial changes that created new functionality. 

I took the implementation of a soduku solver from the blog post at https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/fast-sudoku-solver-in-haskell-1/ and converted it to solving soduko X variant games.

The complexity of the program was far greater than the current level of the class, and diving into the program to see where alterations could be made was initially rather daunting. 

The key to the initial implementation was the function pruneGrid. 
The board's state at any step of the algorithm is represented as a two dimensional grid of fixed cells, and unfixed cells with a set of possible values.

For the search algorithm to narrow down a solution, pruneGrid takes a sudoku grid and for each unfixed cell in the grid it removes all possible values from that cell that are equal to the value of a fixed cell in that unfixed cellâ€™s row, as they would violate the rules of sudoku.

The same operation is performed on the columns of the grid by transposing the grid, making the columns the rows, and passing that grid to pruneGrid. This is done as pruneGrid only makes comparisons between cells in the same row.

To perform the last constraint for regular sudoku, that the 3x3 subgrids must contain all distinct values, the function subGridsToRows takes a sudoku grid and returns a new grid where each of the subgrids is its own row.  This is then pruned by pruneGrid. The resulting grid is then fed back into subGridsToRows that is conveniently its own back-transform. 

In sudoku X the additional constraint is that both the left and right diagonal contain all distinct values. 

As Haskell is a purely functional language I could only pass the output of one grid operation to the next.
Thus the state of the overall grid needed to be maintained during the pruning of the diagonals, to facilitate this the cells from one diagonal were copied from the grid and placed in their own rows. These rows were then appended to the top of the top of the grid and this 10x9 Grid was then pruned. The now pruned diagonal cells were then reinserted into their original diagonal positions in the grid, adding the needed constraint.
